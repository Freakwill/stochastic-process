# Critique of Practical Reason



## Chapter 1

### Definition [Practical Principles]

**Practical Principles** are  propositions which contain a general determination of the will, having under it several practical rules. They are subjective, or *Maxims*, when the condition  is regarded by the subject as valid only for his only will, but objective, or practical laws, if the condition is recognized as objective, that is valid for the will of every rational being.



### Examples

Now tell a man that he should never make a deceitful promise... If now it is found that this rule is practically right, then it is a law, because it is categorical imperative.



### Theorem 1

All PPs which presuppose an object (matter) of the faculty of desire as the ground of determination of the will are empirical, and can furnish no practical laws.



### Keywords

maxims

### Vocabularies

faculty, volition, causality, furnish, attain

### Categories

Subject/object, Susceptibility, Empirical

### Phrases

determining principle of the will, material practical rules, rational beings



### Theorem 2

All MPPs as such are of one and the same kind, and come under the general principle of self-love or private happiness.



### Corollary

All MPRs place the determining priciple of the will in the lower desires, and if there were no purely formal laws of the will adequate to determine it, then we could not admit any higher desire at all.
