## 17 Badness about death

### What is bad about death right here?



How could be anything bad for you when you don't exist?



*Deprivation account of evil or badness of death*

What is bad about being dead is you do not get to experience and enjoy any longer the various good things that life would offer us.



### When it is bad for me?



1. $i: E !\Leftarrow bebadfor(x, i)$ （existence requirement）
2. $dead(i)\Rightarrow  \lnot i: E!$
3. $\lnot bebadfor(death,i)$



> So death, the most terrifying of ills, is nothing to us, since so long as we exist, death is not with us; but when death comes, then we do not exist. It dose not then concern the living or the dead, since for the former it is not, and the latter are not more.

> --- Epicurus

#### existence requirement

*Larry, nonexistence baby exp.*

modest: $i, t: E ! \Leftarrow bebadfor(x, i)$

bold: $i,t: E !\Leftarrow  bebadfor(x, i),t$





*Most of us try very hard to not think hard about death*



There is no soul, we are just machines. ... We are machines capable of loving, capable of dreaming, capable of being creative, capable of making plans and sharing them with others. And the machines break, that's the end. Death is in some sence no more mysterious than the fact that your lamp can break, or your computer can break or any other machines will eventually fail.
