Reading books about social sciences and philosophy ðŸ“š

Reciently, I read some books to help me for thinking and analizing.

In China, since the low quality of education, I really need the authors to inspire and enlighten me.

## Philosophy

- Origins of Analytical Philosopy (in Chinese)
- Critique of Practical Reason

## Social Science

- The Tipping Point
