### Personality

All of us, when it comes to personality, naturally think in terms of absolutes: that a person is a certain way or is not a certain way. But what Zimbardo and Harshorne and May are suggesting is that this is a mistake, when we think only in terms of inherent traits and forget the role of situations, we're deceiving ourselves about the real causes of human behavior.



Psychologists call this tendency the FAE, which is a fancy way of saying that when is comes to interpreting other people's behavior, human beings invariably make the mistakes of overestimating the importance of fundamental character traits and underestimating the importance of the situation and context.
